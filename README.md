Program which calculate composite numbers.  First, the user is instructed to enter the number of composites to be displayed, and is prompted to enter an integer in the range [1 .. 400].  The user enters a number, n, and the program verifies that 1 ≤ n ≤ 400.  If n is out of range, the user is reprompted until s/he enters a value in the specified range.  The program then calculates and displays all of the composite numbers up to and including the nth composite.  The results are displayed 10 composites per line with at least 3 spaces between the numbers.
